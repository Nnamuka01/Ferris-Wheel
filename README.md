## FreeCodeCamp - Ferris Wheel

This is a ferris wheel built for the sole purpose of learning CSS animation. 
For CSS animation, use @keyframes because it defines the flow of animation. It requires a name to be assigned to them which is used in other rules to reference. 
We also have other animation properties such as the animation-duration-property which is used to set how long the animation should sequence to complete.  
We have the animation iteration-count property that sets how many times your animation should repeat.
